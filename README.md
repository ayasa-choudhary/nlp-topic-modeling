# **NLP Topic Handling**

This project demonstrates various techniques and methods used in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to handle and analyze textual data. It covers the entire pipeline, from text cleaning to advanced topic modeling. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of key NLP concepts and their implementation.

## **Key Features of the Case Study**

### **1. Text Preprocessing**
- **Reading Text**: Demonstrated how to load and read text data from various sources (files, APIs, etc.).
- **Cleaning Text**: Removed unnecessary characters, extra spaces, and unwanted symbols.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual tokens (words or phrases).
- **Punctuation Removal**: Removed punctuation to simplify text analysis.

### **2. Stopwords**
- Explained what stopwords are and their importance in NLP.
- **Types of Stopwords**: Discussed default stopwords and domain-specific stopwords.
- Implemented stopword removal using libraries like NLTK and SpaCy.

### **3. Stemming and Lemmatization**
- Applied stemming techniques to reduce words to their root forms.
- Compared stemming with lemmatization for meaningful text analysis.

### **4. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
- Identified parts of speech for each word in the text using SpaCy.
- Used POS tagging for downstream tasks like entity recognition and sentiment analysis.

### **5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- Extracted named entities like people, locations, and organizations using SpaCy.

### **6. Text Vectorization**
- **Bag of Words (BOW)**: Represented text as a collection of unique words with frequency counts.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Transformed text into weighted numerical features for relevance assessment.

### **7. Topic Modeling**
- Used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract topics from a collection of text data.
- Analyzed dominant topics and associated keywords.

### **8. Sentiment Analysis**
- Explored **TextBlob** for polarity and subjectivity scoring of text.
- Classified text based on positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

### **9. N-Grams**
- Generated N-grams (bigrams, trigrams) to analyze word sequences.
- Implemented **padded_everygram_pipeline** for text modeling and smoothing.
